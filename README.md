# COVID-19 Risk Analyzer
Developed a COVID-19 Risk Analyzer using Python, pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and matplotlib to predict patient mortality. Implemented a Random Forest model, optimizing hyperparameters using grid search to analyze comorbidities and demographic data. This improved risk assessment, potentially enhancing resource allocation and patient care strategies.
